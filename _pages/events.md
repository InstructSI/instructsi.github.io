## Upcoming events

### Workshops

- [**Instruct.SI CryoEM Advanced Workshop 2025, Single Particle Analysis**](/spa2025/) – Advanced cryo-EM workshop designed to provide researchers with meaningful, hands-on experience with nearly the entire cryo-EM workflow - from EM grid preparation to 3D structure determination // **11<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> November 2025 at National Institute of Chemistry, Ljubljana, Slovenia** // organized by National Institute of Chemistry, supported by Instruct.SI
- [**Rosetta workshop**](/events/rosetta_workshop_2025) – Workshop focused on applying PyRosetta and AI tools like RFdiffusion or ProteinMPNN to the design and engineering of proteins, organized one week before [European RosettaCon](https://instruct-eric.si/events/rosetta_con_2025/) in Ljubljana, Slovenia // organized by National Institute of Chemistry, supported by Instruct.SI and Rosetta Commons

### Conferences

- [**4th European Rosetta Protein Design Conference**](https://europeanrosettacon.org/) ([our announcement]((https://instruct-eric.si/events/rosetta_con_2025/))) – A gathering of the Rosetta modeling and protein design community, bringin together scientists from diverse fields—structural biology, computational modeling, bioengineering, and machine learning // **20<sup>th</sup> to 22<sup>nd</sup> October 2025 at Grand Hotel Union Eurostars, Ljubljana, Slovenia** // supported by Instruct.SI, Rosetta Commons and Slovenian Biochemical Society
