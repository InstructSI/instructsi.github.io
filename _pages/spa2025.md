We are pleased to report the successful completion of the **Instruct.SI CryoEM Advanced Workshop 2025, Single Particle Analysis**, held from 11 to 14 November 2025 at the National Institute of Chemistry in Ljubljana. This hands-on workshop brought together a small but highly engaged group of six participants, creating an intensive learning environment focused on practical skills throughout the entire cryo-EM workflow. Participants presented their research projects as flash presentations, leading to a fruitful exchange of ideas among peers from different fields.

A key feature of this year’s workshop was the opportunity for participants to bring their own research samples. Four attendees took advantage of this, and all participants prepared multiple cryoEM grids during the practical sessions. Under close mentorship from several tutors, they successfully vitrified their samples, gained confidence in handling the Vitrobot IV, and developed a strong understanding of best practices for grid preparation. The small-group format allowed for individualised guidance and ensured that everyone produced usable grids and learned from real experimental outcomes. Beyond sample preparation, the workshop also emphasised microscope operation, screening strategies, and data collection. Participants worked with the 200 kV Glacios cryoTEM, learning step by step from how to load grids to setting up data collection.

The final part of the programme focused on data processing and 3D reconstruction, giving participants a complete overview of the single particle analysis pipeline – from motion correction and CTF estimation to particle picking, 2D classification, and initial 3D refinement. Guided sessions supported by five tutors enabled each participant to follow the process on a real dataset and understand how individual steps influence the final result.

Overall, the workshop offered a concentrated and highly practical experience, allowing participants not only to observe but also to actively perform each stage of the workflow. The positive feedback we received underscores the value of small, skill-focused workshops within the Instruct.SI community. Building on this success, we aim to continue offering advanced, practice-oriented training opportunities to support researchers in Slovenia as they further develop expertise in cryo-electron microscopy.

**Researchers who wish to deepen their understanding of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are cordially invited to attend the Instruct.SI Cryo-EM Advanced Workshop on Single Particle Analysis.**

![Invitation Collage SPA 2025]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spa2025/Invitation_collage_v1.png)

Based on the very positive response to the [Basics of Methodological Approaches in Structural Biology workshop in 2024](https://instruct-eric.si/bmasb2024), Instruct.SI and National Institute of Chemistry are pleased to invite applications for an in-person cryo-EM workshop designed to provide researchers with meaningful, hands-on experience with nearly the entire cryo-EM workflow - from EM grid preparation to 3D structure determination of (biological) macrolecules.

**The workshop program will include:**
 <ul>
  <li>Theoretical background of the cryo-EM method</li>
  <li>Practical work in small, mentored teams</li>
  <li>Experimental sessions will include grid preparation with TFS Vitrobot Mk IVs and data acquisition with TFS Glacios (microscope loading, data collection)</li>
  <li>Cryo-EM data processing and analysis with 3D structure determination</li>
  <li>Networking opportunities with experts from the field and other cryo-EM users</li>
</ul> 
<br>

**Programme** <br>
![Programme v1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spa2025/Programme_SPA2025_v1.png)

**Date and place** <br>
The workshop will be held **from 11<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> November 2025** at the **National Institute of Chemistry**, [Hajdrihova ulica 19, Ljubljana, Slovenia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.042711&mlon=14.493613#map=19/46.042711/14.493613).
<br>

**Who should apply:**<br>
This workshop is aimed at researchers, especially young scientists (PhD students and postdocs), who already have basic knowledge of cryo-EM but wish to acquire or improve practical skills in cryo-EM to enable their independent research.
**Participation is limited to scientists based in Slovenia.** Up to eight (8) applicants will be selected based on their **short CV and motivation letter** to ensure a high-quality hands-on experience. Applicants will also have the opportunity to briefly present their research and bring their own samples. Up to two of these samples will be selected for cryo-EM analysis during the workshop. Samples will be chosen based on their quality and suitability.

## Registration
There is no registration fee, lunch and coffee breaks are included. <br>
