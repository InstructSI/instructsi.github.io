**Researchers who wish to deepen their understanding of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are cordially invited to attend the Instruct.SI Cryo-EM Advanced Workshop on Single Particle Analysis.**

![Invitation Collage SPA 2025]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spa2025/Invitation_collage_v1.png)

Based on the very positive response to the [Basics of Methodological Approaches in Structural Biology workshop in 2024](https://instruct-eric.si/bmasb2024), Instruct.SI and National Institute of Chemistry are pleased to invite applications for an in-person cryo-EM workshop designed to provide researchers with meaningful, hands-on experience with nearly the entire cryo-EM workflow - from EM grid preparation to 3D structure determination of (biological) macrolecules.

**The workshop program will include:**
 <ul>
  <li>Theoretical background of the cryo-EM method</li>
  <li>Practical work in small, mentored teams</li>
  <li>Experimental sessions will include grid preparation with TFS Vitrobot Mk IVs and data acquisition with TFS Glacios (microscope loading, data collection)</li>
  <li>Cryo-EM data processing and analysis with 3D structure determination</li>
  <li>Networking opportunities with experts from the field and other cryo-EM users</li>
</ul> 
<br>

**Programme** <br>
![Programme v1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spa2025/Programme_SPA2025_v1.png)

**Date and place** <br>
The workshop will be held **from 11<sup>th</sup> to 14<sup>th</sup> November 2025** at the **National Institute of Chemistry**, [Hajdrihova ulica 19, Ljubljana, Slovenia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.042711&mlon=14.493613#map=19/46.042711/14.493613).
<br>

**Who should apply:**<br>
This workshop is aimed at researchers, especially young scientists (PhD students and postdocs), who already have basic knowledge of cryo-EM but wish to acquire or improve practical skills in cryo-EM to enable their independent research.
**Participation is limited to scientists based in Slovenia.** Up to eight (8) applicants will be selected based on their **short CV and motivation letter** to ensure a high-quality hands-on experience. Applicants will also have the opportunity to briefly present their research and bring their own samples. Up to two of these samples will be selected for cryo-EM analysis during the workshop. Samples will be chosen based on their quality and suitability.

## Registration
There is no registration fee, lunch and coffee breaks are included. <br>
