We’re pleased to share the announcement and support the **4th EU Rosetta Protein Design Conference**, a gathering of the Rosetta modeling and protein design community, which will be held **Ljubljana, Slovenia**, from **20th to 22nd October 2025** ([flyer]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2025-07-29-rosetta_con_2025-flyer.pdf)).

RosettaCon brings together scientists from diverse fields—structural biology, computational modeling, bioengineering, and machine learning—to explore the latest developments in:
- Protein design with Rosetta and deep learning
- Structural modeling of proteins, protein-ligand interactions, antibodies, membrane proteins, protein-nucleic acid complexes and and all other macromolecules you like to model
- Antibody and vaccine design
- Enzyme design
- AlphaFold, ESMFold, RoseTTAFold, ProteinMPNN, language models for
- structure prediction and design
- Language models to bridge chemistry and biology
- Code development and community involvement

Whether you’re a long-time user of Rosetta, new to the field, or simply curious about the future of protein structure prediction and design, Rosetta Protein Design Conference offers a welcoming, scientifically rich environment to connect, learn, and collaborate.

Participants from the [member institutions of the Instruct.SI consortium]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/about/#member-institutions) are eligible for the same price as Slovenian Biohemical Society (SBD) and Rosetta Commons members. Additionally, a limited number of spots are available for master’s students at a discounted price of 15 EUR. Students can use the voucher code MSCBSC during registration to access this rate.

The conference is organized with the support of [Instruct.SI](https://instruct-eric.si), [Slovenian Biohemical Society (SBD)](http://sbd.si), [National Institute of Chemistry](https://www.ki.si/), and [Rosetta Commons](https://rosettacommons.org/).
