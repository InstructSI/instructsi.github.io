One week before the [**4<sup>th</sup> EU Rosetta Protein Design Conference**](/events/rosetta_con_2025/) in Ljubljana, Slovenia, there will be a separate but connected event â€“ the **Rosetta Workshop** from 14<sup>th</sup> to 18<sup>th</sup> October 2025. The workshop will take place in the Large Lecture Hall of the [National Institute of Chemistry, Hajdrihova 19, Ljubljana](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=46.042711&mlon=14.493613#map=19/46.042711/14.493613).

 The workshop will focus on **applying PyRosetta and AI tools like RFdiffusion or ProteinMPNN to the design and engineering of proteins**. The workshop is intended for early career researchers who look to get a wide overview of modern computational design techniques, try them out and discuss their use cases, limitations, and ways to improve them. **The prerequisites for the workshop are**:
- Basic knowledge of python (for loops, jupyter notebook, Google Colab).
- Basic knowledge of protein structure and intermolecular interactions (h-bonds, salt bridges, secondary structure of proteins).
- You need to bring your own laptop and have a Google account.

Few more details:
- Event start: Tuesday, 14<sup>th</sup> of October 2025, at 10:00 AM
- Event end: Saturday, 18<sup>th</sup> of October 2025, at 1:00 PM
